# contao-tawk.to
Tawk.to Live Chat Backend and Frontend integration for Contao, a Open Source CMS

## How to use?
With the extension there come two templates **be_tawkto.html5** and **tawkto_default.html5**. Create a new template and replace the ```$TawkToUrl``` variable content.

Don't forget to activate where you want to use the chat under **System->Settings->Tawk.to Live Chat** section.

## Where do I get a tawk.to Url?
1. You can register for a free account at https://www.tawk.to - instructions will be provided during setup by tawk.to
2. Or you'll get it from your support team - most likely when you are using tawk.to in the backend.
